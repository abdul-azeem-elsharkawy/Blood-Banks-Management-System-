# Blood Bank Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Blood Bank Management System** is a comprehensive database-driven application designed to streamline blood donation processes, manage inventory, and facilitate blood requests between hospitals and donors. The system integrates an efficient **SQL database** for data management and a **.NET framework** for a user-friendly graphical interface.

## 🚀 Features
- **Donor & Recipient Management:** Store and retrieve personal details, medical history, and donation records.
- **Blood Inventory Tracking:** Maintain accurate records of available blood units, expiration dates, and storage conditions.
- **Transfusion & Disposal Records:** Monitor blood usage, ensure proper disposal, and maintain compliance with healthcare standards.
- **Medical Staff Management:** Secure authentication and role-based access control for healthcare professionals.
- **Data Integrity & Security:** Enforced constraints, relationships, and validation checks to maintain accuracy and prevent redundancy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Backend:** .NET Framework (C#)
- **Frontend:** Windows Forms/WPF (if applicable)
- **Tools:** Visual Studio, MySQL Workbench/PostgreSQL

## 📂 Database Schema
The database consists of **30+ interrelated tables** covering donor, recipient, inventory, transfusions, and medical staff records. Key design principles applied:
- **Normalization:** Eliminated redundancy and ensured efficient data structuring.
- **Constraints:** Implemented **primary keys, foreign keys, CHECK constraints, and ON DELETE CASCADE** for referential integrity.
- **Optimized Queries:** Enhanced performance for data retrieval and storage operations.
